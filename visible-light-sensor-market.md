<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Visible Light Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flash Effect Sensor</li><li>External Photoelectric Effect Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flash Effect Sensor is a type of visible light sensor that uses the principle of photoconductivity to detect light. It operates by the generation of an electric current when light strikes the sensor, allowing it to measure the intensity of light. On the other hand, External Photoelectric Effect Sensor works based on the concept of the photoelectric effect, where photons of light cause the emission of electrons from a material. Both types of sensors are commonly used in applications where precise light detection is required, such as in cameras, security systems, and automatic lighting controls.</p></p>
