<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber-coupled Modulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SM Fiber</li><li>SMPM Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber-coupled modulators are devices used in optical communication systems to modulate light signals traveling through optical fibers. There are two main types of fiber-coupled modulators - SM Fiber and SMPM Fiber. SM Fiber modulators are designed for single-mode fibers, which have a small core size and are ideal for long-distance transmission. SMPM Fiber modulators, on the other hand, are designed for polarization-maintaining fibers, which are used to maintain the polarization state of light signals. Both types of modulators play a crucial role in ensuring efficient and reliable optical communication.</p></p>
