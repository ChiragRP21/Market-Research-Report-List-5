<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barriers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective type</li><li>Absorptive type</li><li>Mixed type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Noise barriers come in three main types in the market: reflective, absorptive, and mixed types. Reflective barriers work by reflecting sound waves, preventing them from passing through. Absorptive barriers absorb sound waves, reducing noise levels by converting sound energy into heat. Mixed barriers combine both reflective and absorptive properties to efficiently block and absorb sound, offering a balanced solution for noise reduction. Each type caters to different noise control needs, making it important for buyers to choose the appropriate barrier for their specific requirements.</p></p>
