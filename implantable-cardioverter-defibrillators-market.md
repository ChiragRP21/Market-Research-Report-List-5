<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transvenous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators</li><li>Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transvenous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (T-ICDs) are devices implanted inside the chest to monitor and correct abnormal heart rhythms by delivering electric shocks. They are connected to the heart through leads placed in the veins. In contrast, Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (S-ICDs) are placed just under the skin, eliminating the need for leads inside the heart. Both types of devices are used to prevent sudden cardiac death in patients at risk of life-threatening arrhythmias.</p></p>
