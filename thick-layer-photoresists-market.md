<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Layer Photoresists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresists</li><li>Negative Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thick layer photoresists are a type of material used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. Positive photoresists are those that are sensitive to UV light and become soluble when exposed, making them suitable for creating patterns on a substrate. On the other hand, negative photoresists are materials that become insoluble when exposed to light, allowing for the creation of patterns by etching away the unexposed areas. Both positive and negative photoresists play a crucial role in the fabrication of microelectronic components and circuits.</p></p>
