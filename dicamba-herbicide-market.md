<p><strong>The Dicamba Herbicide Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-emergence</li><li>Post-emergence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dicamba herbicide is commonly used in agriculture for effective weed control. When applied as a pre-emergence herbicide, it prevents the germination of weed seeds, providing a barrier against weed growth. In contrast, as a post-emergence herbicide, it targets actively growing weeds, killing them before they can compete with crops for resources. Both applications are crucial in maintaining healthy crop yields and maximizing productivity in agricultural settings.</p></p>
