<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DeNOx Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Honeycomb</li><li>Flat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The DeNOx catalyst market can be categorized into two main types: honeycomb and flat catalysts. Honeycomb catalysts have a structured design with channels that allow for efficient flow of exhaust gases, resulting in higher conversion rates of harmful emissions. On the other hand, flat catalysts have a simpler, flat surface design, which may be more cost-effective but may not offer the same level of performance as honeycomb catalysts. Both types of catalysts play a crucial role in reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from various industrial processes.</p></p>
