<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ositive Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Concentration</li><li>Low Concentration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive photoresist is a material used in semiconductor manufacturing to transfer circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. The market for positive photoresist can be divided into two main types based on concentration levels: high concentration and low concentration. High concentration photoresists are characterized by a higher density of photosensitive molecules, making them more sensitive to light and suitable for fine line patterning. On the other hand, low concentration photoresists have a lower density of photosensitive molecules, making them less sensitive to light and better suited for larger features and lower resolution patterning.</p></p>
