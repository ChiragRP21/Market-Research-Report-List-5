<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laparoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Flexible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laparoscopes are minimally invasive surgical instruments used for visualizing internal organs during procedures. There are two main types of laparoscopes: rigid and flexible. Rigid laparoscopes have a straight, rigid structure that provides a high-quality image but with limited maneuverability. Flexible laparoscopes, on the other hand, have a more flexible tip that allows for better access to hard-to-reach areas, although the image quality may not be as sharp. Both types of laparoscopes cater to different surgical needs and preferences.</p></p>
