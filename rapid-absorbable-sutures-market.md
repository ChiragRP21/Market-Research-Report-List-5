<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rapid Absorbable Sutures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Absorbable Sutures</li><li>Synthetic Absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rapid absorbable sutures are categorized into two main types: natural absorbable sutures and synthetic absorbable sutures. Natural absorbable sutures are made from materials like catgut which are biodegradable and break down naturally in the body over time. Synthetic absorbable sutures are made from materials like polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid, which are also biodegradable but are manufactured to have a faster absorption rate than natural sutures. Both types are used in surgeries where the sutures need to be absorbed by the body quickly.</p></p>
