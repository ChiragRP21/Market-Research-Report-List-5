<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shielded Type TBMs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Shielded</li><li>Double Shielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shielded Type TBMs are commonly categorized into two main types: Single Shielded and Double Shielded. Single Shielded TBMs consist of a single shield that protects the tunnel face from collapsing while excavating. These TBMs are typically used in stable ground conditions. On the other hand, Double Shielded TBMs have both a front shield and a rear shield, providing additional support to the tunnel face and allowing for simultaneous excavation and lining installation. Double Shielded TBMs are often used in varying ground conditions to ensure tunnel stability and efficient construction.</p></p>
