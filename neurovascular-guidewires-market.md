<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurovascular Guidewires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Guide Wire</li><li>Wrapped Guide Wire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neurovascular guidewires are used in interventional neurovascular procedures to navigate through blood vessels. There are two main types of neurovascular guidewires: solid guide wires and wrapped guide wires. Solid guide wires have a consistent diameter throughout their length, providing stability and control during navigation. Wrapped guide wires, on the other hand, have a coiled structure which offers increased flexibility and maneuverability. Both types of guidewires are essential tools in neurovascular interventions, with each offering distinct advantages depending on the specific procedure being performed.</p></p>
