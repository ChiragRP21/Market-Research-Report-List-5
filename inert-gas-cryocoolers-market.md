<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inert Gas Cryocoolers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Loop</li><li>Open Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Closed loop inert gas cryocoolers use a closed system to circulate an inert gas, such as helium or nitrogen, to cool down a target object by absorbing its heat. On the other hand, open loop inert gas cryocoolers use an open system where the gas is continuously vented out and replaced with fresh inert gas. Closed loop cryocoolers are more energy-efficient and cost-effective as they recycle the gas, while open loop cryocoolers are simpler in design but require a constant supply of inert gas.</p></p>
