<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fence Detection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fence Mounted Intrusion Detection</li><li>Wall Mounted Intrusion Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fence detection systems come in two main types: fence mounted intrusion detection and wall mounted intrusion detection. Fence mounted systems are installed directly onto existing fences to detect any breaches or intrusions. This type of system is ideal for outdoor perimeter security. On the other hand, wall mounted intrusion detection systems are mounted onto walls and can provide indoor or outdoor security. Both types of systems use sensors and alarms to alert property owners of potential breaches, offering peace of mind and enhanced security measures.</p></p>
