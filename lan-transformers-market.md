<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LAN Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PoE</li><li>Non-PoE</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LAN transformers are essential components in networking devices to ensure smooth data transmission. The market can be classified into two types - Power over Ethernet (PoE) and Non-PoE. PoE transformers allow power and data to be transmitted over a single Ethernet cable, simplifying installation and reducing the need for multiple power sources. On the other hand, Non-PoE transformers are used in devices where power can be supplied separately from data. Both types play a vital role in maintaining efficient and reliable network connections.</p></p>
