<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RJ45 Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shielded</li><li>Unshielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RJ45 connectors are commonly used for Ethernet networking. They come in two main types: shielded and unshielded. Shielded connectors are designed with an extra layer of protection to minimize electromagnetic interference, making them ideal for industrial or high-noise environments. Unshielded connectors, on the other hand, are more cost-effective and suitable for general use in office or home settings. Both types offer reliable connectivity for Ethernet cables, with shielded connectors providing added protection against external interference.</p></p>
