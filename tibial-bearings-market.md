<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tibial Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mobile-bearing</li><li>Fixed-bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tibial bearings are used in knee replacement surgeries and are available in two main types: mobile-bearing and fixed-bearing. Mobile-bearing implants allow for greater movement and rotation compared to fixed-bearing implants, potentially reducing wear and improving longevity. On the other hand, fixed-bearing implants are more stable and provide better support, making them suitable for patients with higher activity levels or those looking for a more rigid knee structure. Both types have their own set of advantages and considerations for patients undergoing knee replacement surgery.</p></p>
