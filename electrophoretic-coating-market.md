<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrophoretic Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anodic Electrophoretic Coating</li><li>Cathodic Electrophoretic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrophoretic coating is a process used in the automotive industry where paint particles are attracted to a metal surface to provide a strong and durable protective coating. There are two main types of electrophoretic coating: anodic and cathodic. Anodic electrophoretic coating involves positively charged paint particles being attracted to the negatively charged metal surface, while cathodic electrophoretic coating involves the opposite - negatively charged paint particles being attracted to the positively charged metal surface. Both types provide excellent corrosion resistance and adhesion properties.</p></p>
