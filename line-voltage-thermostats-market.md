<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Line-Voltage Thermostats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Pole Wiring</li><li>Double Pole Wiring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Line-voltage thermostats come in two main types: single pole wiring and double pole wiring. Single pole wiring thermostats are typically used in systems where only one hot wire controls the heating source. Double pole wiring thermostats, on the other hand, are used in systems where both hot wires are used to control the heating source. Single pole wiring thermostats are more common and easier to install, while double pole wiring thermostats offer added safety and stability in heating systems.</p></p>
