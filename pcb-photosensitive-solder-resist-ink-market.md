<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB Photosensitive Solder Resist Ink Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Photosensitive</li><li>Uv Cured</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PCB photosensitive solder resist ink is available in two main types - liquid photosensitive and UV cured. Liquid photosensitive ink is applied as a liquid coating onto the PCB and hardens when exposed to UV light, creating a protective layer against soldering. UV cured solder resist ink is pre-applied to the PCB and hardens instantly when exposed to UV light, eliminating the need for a separate application step. Both types offer efficient and precise coverage for soldering applications on printed circuit boards.</p></p>
