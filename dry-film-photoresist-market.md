<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Film Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive</li><li>Negative</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dry film photoresist is available in two main types: positive and negative. In positive photoresist, areas exposed to light become soluble and are removed during the developing process, leaving behind the desired pattern. Negative photoresist, on the other hand, involves areas that are not exposed to light becoming soluble, allowing the desired pattern to be revealed. Both types offer unique advantages and are used in various industries for applications such as PCB manufacturing, MEMS fabrication, and semiconductor packaging.</p></p>
