<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ToF Ranging Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Wave ToF</li><li>Gate ToF</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ToF Ranging Sensor Market consists of two main types, Continuous Wave ToF and Gate ToF. Continuous Wave ToF sensors emit a continuous beam of light and measure the time taken for the light to reflect back from an object to calculate distance. On the other hand, Gate ToF sensors emit short pulses of light and use a synchronized sensor to measure the time taken for the light to be reflected back. Both types of sensors are commonly used in applications such as robotics, automotive, and industrial automation for distance measurement and object detection.</p></p>
