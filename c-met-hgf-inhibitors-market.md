<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The C-MET & HGF Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cabozantinib</li><li>Crizotinib</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>C-MET & HGF inhibitors are a type of drug that target the C-MET protein and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). This market includes drugs like Cabozantinib, Crizotinib, and others that inhibit the C-MET/HGF pathway, which is often dysregulated in cancer and other diseases. These inhibitors work by blocking the binding of HGF to the C-MET receptor, thereby inhibiting downstream signaling pathways that promote cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis. These drugs are important in the treatment of various cancers and other diseases where the C-MET/HGF pathway is overactive.</p></p>
