<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Paving Geotextiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Woven Fibres</li><li>Non-woven Fibres</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Paving geotextiles are used in road construction and landscaping to improve the strength and durability of the pavement. There are two main types of paving geotextiles: woven fibres and non-woven fibres. Woven fibres are made by weaving synthetic fibres together, creating a strong and durable material. Non-woven fibres are created by bonding fibres together through thermal, chemical, or mechanical processes. Both types of paving geotextiles provide reinforcement and stabilization to the pavement, reducing the risk of cracking and rutting.</p></p>
